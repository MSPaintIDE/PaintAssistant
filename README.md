# PaintAssistant

PaintAssistant is a library to authenticate the user via their Google account, and then listen for Firebase updates for their entry in the project's firebase database controlled by the server and Google Assistant with the [Assistant Backend](https://github.com/MSPaintIDE/AssistantBackend).

This project is specific to [MS Paint IDE](https://github.com/MSPaintIDE/MSPaintIDE), though can serve as a great example if you're getting into this kind of thing.

## Demo
